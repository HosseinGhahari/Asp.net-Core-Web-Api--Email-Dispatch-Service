<h1>Asp.net Core Web Api - Email Dispatch Service</h1>

<p style="font-size:16px;">✅ I’ve developed a Web API for the backend service of my personal website.This API <br> built with ASP.NET Core, handles email transmissions.It works by processing<br>messages that clients submit through a form on the website.Once the form is <br>  filled out and submitted, the API takes care of sending the email.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;">✅  In the process of programming the API, I adhered to clean code requirements <br> and SOLID principles. Key principles such as dependency injection <br> have been fully implemented and are functioning as expected.</p>

<h2>‼️Important Notice :</h2>
<p style="font-size:16px;">🔹To use and customize this API, please follow these steps :</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:16px;">🔸The API operates by using two personal emails <br> one for sending and another for receiving.</p>
<p style="font-size:16px;">🔸Navigate to AppSettings.Json in the project and ensure that you’ve <br> filled out the necessary details for both the sender and receiver email accounts. <br> Use your own two emails for this purpose.</p>
<p style="font-size:16px;">🔸The email account used for sending should have ‘AppPassword’ enabled. <br> This can be easily done in the security settings of your Google account <br> if you’re using Gmail. Use this ‘AppPassword’ as the password for the sender email.</p>
